# FEM Solver

simple cpp algorithm for solving acustic vibration differential equation using finite element method. Project for university course.

-u"(x)-u(x)=sin(x), Ω=(0, 2)

u(0)=1

u"(2)-u(2)=5

### Requirements
- C++ compiler

### Running

```bash
.\build
.\solve n  
```
Where n is the number of sections in fem.

### Results
algorithms writes calculated result to result.csv file
